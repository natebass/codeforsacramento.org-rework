CutePetsSac is a Twitter bot that tweets a random pet from the City of Sacramento's Animal Care Services. We're
looking for someone who can lead this project by taking over the Twitter account and getting the word out about
cute pets waiting to be adopted. Interested? Hit us up: pets [at] codeforsacramento [dot] org
