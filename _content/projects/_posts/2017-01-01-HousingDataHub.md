The Sacramento Housing Data Hub was inspired by a desire to provide community members with a common set of facts and
data surrounding the complex issue of housing affordability in the Sacramento area. The site, a work in progress,
is a comprehensive website to help Sacramento area residents understand the housing market, including for-sale
inventory, single-family detached and multi-family rentals, subsidized affordable units, and more. The site will
feature housing data visualizations, the relationship between housing costs, vacancy rates, income, and the local
economy, explore existing and potential policy solutions, and catalogue the ongoing discussion at the federal, state,
 and local level.
